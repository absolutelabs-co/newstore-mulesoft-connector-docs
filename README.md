# About MuleSoft Certified Connectors
MuleSoft Certified Connectors, including the NewStore Connector, are created by MuleSoft's partners and community developers and have been officially reviewed and certified by MuleSoft. 


If you need help with the connector contact AbsoluteLabs directly at  [Contact us | Absolutelabs](https://www.absolutelabs.co/contact-us). MuleSoft does not provide support for these connectors.

Installing this connector means you agree to let MuleSoft share your contact details with AbsoluteLabs (the connector's developer) so they can send you more information. You can try the connector for free, but you cannot use it in a live production environment. 

To use the NewStore connector in a live production environment, you must either buy a license from AbsoluteLabs or get it as part of a service package from them. Once you've purchased a license or service package, you'll receive support and maintenance according to the terms of your contract.
